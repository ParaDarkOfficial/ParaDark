# Quantum Reactor Facility

**Alias / Title:** The "Truth Engine" Facility
**Dimension:** [Prime Dimension](/lore/canon/locations/prime-dimension.md)
**Status:** Destroyed

---

## Summary
This is the high-tech research facility that housed the **[Prime Reactor Core](/lore/canon/artifacts/prime-reactor-core.md)**. It was the workplace of **[Victor James](/lore/canon/characters/victor-james.md)** and **[Rook Valer](/lore/canon/characters/rook-valer.md)**.

The entire facility is now a "dimensional hotspot," a place where reality is thin and "Tears" happen often.

## The Machine (The "Truth Engine")
The "Truth Engine" was the massive containment machine built around the Core. It was not just a power plant; it was an experiment designed to:
1.  Observe other dimensions safely.
2.  Use the Core's energy to refract quantum light.
3.  Prove that multiple realities exist.

The machine itself was a sphere of magnetic rings, lasers, and coolant pipes, all focused on the floating Core at its center.

## The Accident
The machine failed during its first full-power test. The containment rings overloaded, and the Core's energy imploded.
* The machine was vaporized.
* The Core **shattered into 100 "Shards of Worlds."**
* A massive "Tear" was ripped open, bathing the facility (and Victor and Rook) in raw dimensional energy.

## (Help Wanted!)
* What was the *official name* of the research company that ran this facility?
* Who was the *third* scientist on the team who is now missing?
