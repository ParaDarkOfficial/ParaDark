# The Core Rules of the MythWeave Universe

Welcome, contributor! This file contains the "official rules" of our universe.

All stories in the `/lore/community` folder can be creative, but anything that follows these rules might be promoted to official `/canon`!

## Rule 1: The Multiverse
Our universe is a "multiverse" made of many different dimensions.
* **The "Prime" Dimension:** This is our "main" reality, where most heroes and cities are.
* **Other Dimensions:** There are unknown numbers of other dimensions (a fantasy dimension, a shadow dimension, a sci-fi dimension, etc.).
* **(Help Wanted! We need to name these dimensions. Add your idea to the `/lore/community/locations` folder!)**

## Rule 2: The "Tears"
* People get "superpowers" or travel between dimensions when a "Tear" in reality happens.
* A "Tear" is a rare, dangerous event.
* **(Help Wanted! What causes a "Tear"? A magic spell? A science experiment? Add your idea to the `/lore/community/myths` folder!)**

## Rule 3: Heroes & Villains
* Most "superheroes" are normal people who were changed by a "Tear."
* This is a superhero-themed universe. We are looking for stories about heroes, villains, and their powers.
