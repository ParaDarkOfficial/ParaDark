## The Story

### The Prime Dimension

Earth Prime is the original and central dimension — a normal, modern world with sprawling cities, vast oceans, and structured governments much like the Polish version of our world. Yet, beneath its ordinary surface lies a hidden anomaly: the German city of **Bielefeld**.  

Unlike any other city, **Bielefeld** operates under its own independent council, free from national governance — a reflection of the real-world myth that questions its very existence. In this universe, however, Bielefeld is real — and its secrets run deeper than anyone dares to believe.

At the heart of the city stands **Bielefeld University**, a prestigious yet enigmatic institution. Within its walls lies the **Weather Factory**, a massive research unit that controls and studies atmospheric behavior — but beyond that, something stranger hums beneath the campus. Deep below the university grounds, hidden from public record, is where it all began.

### The Spark Beneath Bielefeld

Hidden deep beneath the quiet courtyards of **[Bielefeld University](/lore/canon/locations/bielefeld.md)** — inside the forbidden **[Dr. Oetker "Anomaly Wing"](/lore/canon/locations/dr-oetker-anomaly-wing.md)** — stood an unregistered research lab that defied every known law of physics.  
The facility, known officially as the **[Quantum Reactor Facility](/lore/canon/locations/quantum-reactor-facility.md)**, was secretly built by the private research syndicate **Aeternum Dynamics**. The lab’s true purpose: to recreate the metaphysical anomaly that made Bielefeld a “phantom city” and prove that reality itself was layered — a structure of coexisting truths.

At the center of the facility hovered the **[Prime Reactor Core](/lore/canon/artifacts/prime-reactor-core.md)** — a crystalline engine designed to refract quantum light and stabilize dimensional folds. Around it spun the **Truth Engine**, a massive cage of magnetic rings, lasers, and coolant conduits, all synchronized to channel power from the Bielefeld anomaly.

The team of three was unmatched:
- **[Victor James](/lore/canon/characters/victor-james.md)**, the visionary physicist, believed the experiment could let humanity see the structure of truth itself.  
- **[Rook Valer](/lore/canon/characters/rook-valer.md)**, the molecular biologist, was fascinated by how living matter could adapt to interdimensional exposure.  
- **Dr. Elara Vance**, the pragmatic systems engineer, monitored the containment and neural feedback filters — the last line between science and disaster.

“Victor, the core is unstable,” Elara warned, her hands flying over the control panel. “The energy resonance—it’s feeding off the Bielefeld anomaly. It’s chaotic.”

“It’s just background noise,” Rook countered. “The bio-shielding is holding. We’re on the verge of *controlling* the anomaly, not just observing it. Victor, we have to proceed.”

Victor hesitated, then made the choice that would unmake reality. “Push the injection. Just for a moment.”

That single moment was enough.  
The Core ignited — not in light, but in **truth**. The containment rings screamed as spacetime bent inward. Then, with a sound like glass breaking inside a dream, the **Truth Engine** collapsed. The Core shattered into a hundred burning fragments — **Shards of Worlds** — and a wave of raw, dimensionless energy tore through the room.

- Victor was struck by the **Truth Layer**, his consciousness forever fused with the ability to perceive absolute reality. He would awaken as **Veritas, the Seer of Truth**.  
- Rook was engulfed in the **Chaos Layer**, his molecular form unraveling and reassembling endlessly. From that day forward, he became **Morphis, the Shifting Shadow**.  
- Elara Vance, standing closest to the Core, was simply… gone. Some say she was annihilated; others whisper she became *something else* — a living equation adrift between worlds.

The blast ruptured the spatial fabric of Bielefeld itself. The city flickered — real one second, illusion the next — its existence now tethered to the remnants of the shattered Core buried deep below the **Anomaly Wing**. The **Quantum Reactor Facility** was destroyed, and Aeternum Dynamics was erased from public record.

When the dust settled, only two figures emerged from the ruins — one burdened with truth, the other consumed by lies.  
And somewhere, in the quiet between dimensions, the voice of Elara Vance still echoes through the rift… counting down to whatever comes next.

## (Help Wanted!)
* What truly happened to **Dr. Elara Vance** — annihilated, transformed, or reborn in another layer?  
* How did the **Anomaly Wing** react to the shockwave — did the “Conceptual Hum” cease, or evolve into something dangerous?  
* Who found the **first Shard of Worlds**, and what impossible gift or curse did it grant?
