# DR. Oether: The Anomaly Wing



**Title:** The Edible Conspiracy / The Anomaly Wing
**Home Dimension:** Prime Dimension (Sub-dimensional resonance detected)
**Location**: Bielefeld, Metamorphose Academia (Restricted Sub-Basement Complex 4)

---

## Summary
The Dr. Oetker complex is not a separate factory but the most secretive and vital organ of Bielefeld University. Known to the Intelligentsia as "The Anomaly Wing," it is a vast, immaculate study in misplaced effort, operating as the university's primary engine for transmuting pure theory into physical, stable matter.The structure itself is baffling. Located in a restricted sub-basement complex beneath the university's main quad, it emits a profound industrial quietness. This hum is, in fact, the ambient resonance of the Analog-Arcana machinery, a bizarrely concealed energy source that seems to draw its power directly from the focused conceptual output of the Fecund Ring.The Wing's purpose is not production in any conventional sense; it is metaphysical alchemy. The 'products'—puddings, baking powders, and cake mixes—are merely the inert, edible vessels for abstract theorems, stabilized and "baked" into reality.

## Peculiarity

* **Analog-Arcana:** The core machinery is "older than the times." These are not assembly lines but massive, non-digital contraptions of brass, obsidian, and cooled steam-pipes that operate on principles of sympathetic resonance and arcane geometry. 

* **Edible Manifestation:** The "products" are the physical, shelf-stable end-products of successful theorems. The 'recipes' are complex proofs, and the 'baking' process is the final stage of locking an abstract idea into the physical world. 

* **The Conceptual Hum:** The persistent low-frequency hum is the sound of this transmutation. Staff (or rather, university "attendants" assigned to the Wing) report "auditory synesthesia," where they begin to hear the "taste" of a quadratic equation or the "smell" of a linguistic paradox. 

## Dimensional Anchor

The Anomaly Wing is the reason Bielefeld seems to exist and not exist (a nod to the real-world "Bielefeld Conspiracy"). The factory's machinery acts as a massive anchor, stabilizing the university's unique pocket of reality. This hints that the complex itself may not be fully native to the Prime Dimension, and that Dr. Oether (the entity or consciousness behind it) is using the university to maintain its foothold.
