# Rook Valer

**Alias / Title:** Morphis, The Shifting Shadow  
**Home Dimension:** Prime Dimension  
**Status:** Alive

## Summary

Lucien Vale, once Victor James’s closest colleague, became Morphis after the same reactor accident. A molecular biologist obsessed with adaptive identity, his body and consciousness fractured across multiple realities. Morphis can alter his form at will, taking on any face, voice, or identity. Yet behind every disguise lies one truth: he no longer remembers who he truly is.

## Powers & Abilities

- **Shapeshifting:** Transform his physical form into anyone he’s seen or studied — from a politician to a creature of nightmare.  
- **Mimicry:** Perfectly replicates voices, mannerisms, and even emotional signatures.  
- **Adaptive Regeneration:** Cells reconfigure when damaged, making him nearly impossible to kill.  
- **Weakness:** The more forms he takes, the weaker his sense of self becomes — risking total identity collapse.

## Origin Story

Lucien Vale worked alongside Victor at the same facility, pioneering bioadaptive research designed to help humanity survive interdimensional exposure. When the containment reactor failed, the quantum field overloaded his DNA with unstable resonance.

While Victor gained clarity — the ability to see truth — Lucien was cursed with chaos, becoming a living paradox of identity. His cells no longer obeyed a single pattern; they responded to intent, not structure.

Now, driven by envy and madness, Morphis seeks to erase the concept of “truth” itself — believing that only through endless transformation can humanity escape the suffering of fixed reality.

## (Help Wanted!)

- Need a name for his original research project before the accident.
- Need a visual cue for when he shapeshifts (e.g., ripple, mirror-flash, or smoke effect).
- Does he secretly remember who Victor really is — or has he forgotten everything?
