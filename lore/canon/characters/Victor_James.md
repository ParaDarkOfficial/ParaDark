# Victor James

**Alias / Title:** Veritas, The Seer of Truth
**Home Dimension:** Prime Dimension
**Status:** Alive

## Summary

Victor James, a brilliant quantum physicist turned reluctant hero, gained the power to perceive absolute truth after a lab experiment tore through the layers of reality. Known as Veritas, he can see through illusions, lies, and hidden motives. In a world where deception rules, he’s the one man who literally cannot be fooled — but knowing the truth comes with a price.

## Powers & Abilities

* **Truthsense:** Can see through illusions, shapeshifters, mind control, and false memories. Lies appear as flickering distortions or color shifts around people.
* **Perception Field:** Can project a zone where others briefly see the truth — useful in revealing hidden enemies or corruption.
* **Enhanced Cognition:** His mind processes information across multiple “truth layers,” allowing him to solve complex problems instantly.
* **Weakness:** Overexposure to lies and paradoxes causes mental overload — he begins to see too much, blurring reality and madness.

## Origin Story

Victor James was leading a government-backed experiment on quantum light refraction — a theory that the fabric of reality is layered, with each layer storing different versions of truth. His goal was to visualize these “truth layers” using a containment reactor that bent photons through artificial singularities.

But when the reactor malfunctioned, Victor didn’t just observe the truth — he merged with it. The unstable energy tore a microscopic rift between dimensions, exposing him to the Truth Layer, a metaphysical plane that contains every fact, every lie, and every hidden intention across time.

When he regained consciousness, his perception was irreversibly altered. His left eye reflected shifting spectrums of light — the mark of exposure to pure, unfiltered truth. From that moment, Victor could see the world as it truly was — every deception unveiled, every shadow unmasked.

Now known as Veritas, he carries both the gift and the curse of absolute perception — a mind forever caught between reality and revelation.

## (Help Wanted!)

* Need a name for the mysterious entity that guards the Truth Layer.
* Need a name for the LAB where he works.
