# Prime Reactor Core

**Alias / Title:** The "Truth Engine"
**Type:** Dimensional Power Source
**Status:** Shattered / Lost

---

## Summary
This is the reactor core built by **[Victor James](/lore/canon/characters/Victor_james.md)** and **[Rook Valer](/lore/canon/characters/Rook_Valer.md)**. During the accident, it imploded and shattered into 100 pieces.

These "Core Fragments" were scattered across the **[Prime Dimension](/lore/canon/locations/prime-dimension.md)** and, in some cases, into other dimensions.

## Powers
* **Main Core (Lost):** Had the power to open "Tears" between dimensions.
* **Core Fragments (Scattered):** Even a small piece can be dangerous. A fragment might:
    * Give a random person superpowers.
    * Warp reality in a small area.
    * Attract creatures from other dimensions.

## (Help Wanted!)
* Who found the *first* fragment after the explosion?
