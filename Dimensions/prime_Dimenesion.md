## Summary


The Prime Dimension is our "home" reality, populated by billions of humans. It is where most of our stories begin.
This dimension is **NOT** destroyed. It is a normal, modern world with cities, oceans, and governments.

## The "Ground Zero" Anomaly


The *only* part of this dimension that is "collapsed" or "destroyed" is the **[Quantum Reactor core](lore/canon/artifacts/Quantum-Reactor.md)**.
Think of this facility as a single "disaster site" or "quarantine zone" on the planet. The rest of the world is safe, but it must now deal with the fallout (like new 'Tears' and 'Shards') coming from that one location.
