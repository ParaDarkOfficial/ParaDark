# MythiQ-Universe Licensing

This project uses a **dual-license model** to protect both code and creative content:

---

## 📄 License Structure

### 1. Code & Software → **MIT License**
**Applies to:** `/app/`, scripts, configuration files, and all technical components

**License file:** [LICENSE](./LICENSE)

✅ You can freely use, modify, and distribute the code  
✅ Commercial use is allowed  
✅ Very permissive and developer-friendly

---

### 2. Creative Content → **CC BY-SA 4.0**
**Applies to:** `/lore/` directory (stories, characters, locations, artifacts, myths)

**License file:** [LICENSE-CONTENT](./LICENSE-CONTENT)

✅ You can share and adapt the content  
✅ **You must give credit** to contributors  
✅ Derivative works must use the same license  
✅ Commercial use is allowed (but must stay open)

## ❓ Why Dual License?

We want:
- 💻 Developers to freely build on the platform
- ✍️ Writers to get credit for their stories
- 🌍 The mythology to remain open and accessible
- 🎮 Future adaptations (games, art, etc.) to give back to the community
