# MystiQ-Universe Licensing

This project uses a **dual-license model** to protect both code and creative content:

---

## License Structure

### 1. Code & Software → **MIT License**
**Applies to:** `/app/`, scripts, configuration files, and all technical components

**License file:** [LICENSE](./LICENSE) (root directory)

- You can freely use, modify, and distribute the code
- Commercial use is allowed
- Very permissive and developer-friendly

---

### 2. Creative Content → **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**
**Applies to:** `/lore/` directory (stories, characters, locations, artifacts, myths)

**License file:** [lore/LICENSE](./lore/LICENSE)

- You can share and adapt the content for **non-commercial use**
- **You must give credit** to contributors
- Derivative works must use the same license
- **Commercial use requires permission** from MystiQ-Universe

---

## Contributing

By contributing to MystiQ-Universe, you agree that:

- **Code contributions** will be licensed under MIT
- **Lore/creative contributions** will be licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
- **MystiQ-Universe retains the right** to use community contributions in official canon, commercial books, and merchandise (with attribution to original creators)
- **Contributors retain** non-commercial rights to their own contributions

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for full contribution guidelines.

## Why Dual License?

We want:
- Developers to freely build on the platform
- Writers to get credit for their stories
- The mythology to remain open and accessible
- Future adaptations (games, art, etc.) to give back to the community

## Summary

| Content Type | License | Commercial Use |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| Code (app, scripts) | MIT | ✅ Allowed |
| Lore (stories, characters) | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | ⚠️ Requires permission |

**TL;DR:** Code is MIT (fully open). Lore is CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (open for fans, but commercial use requires permission from MystiQ-Universe).
