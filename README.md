# Welcome to **ParaDarkOfficial**
> Where myths evolve — together.

**ParaDarkOfficial** is an open-source collaborative mythology universe built by a creative community of **writers, artists, and developers**.  
Every story, artifact, and character is forged right here on **GitHub** — shaping an ever-expanding multiverse of legends.

---

## The Beginning of the Universe

The official origin story of our world is now live:  
  [**Read: The First Spark**](/lore/canon/myths/The_first_spark.md)

It tells the story of the Quantum Reactor accident that fractured the Prime Dimension and scattered 100 **Shards of Worlds** across reality.

---

### Your Mission: Hunt the Shards!

Our origin story, "[The First Spark](/lore/canon/myths/The_first_spark.md)," ended with the **Prime Reactor Core shattering into 100+ "Shards of Worlds."** These shards have scattered across the **[Prime Dimension](/lore/canon/locations/prime-dimension.md)** and maybe even *other dimensions* entirely!

**What do these shards do?**
* They grant **superpowers** to whoever finds them. 
* They can warp reality, creating **anomalies** or **monsters**. 
* They are pieces of immense power, and now **heroes AND villains** are desperately trying to collect them! ⚔️

**This is where YOU come in.** Our goal is to tell the stories of **all 100+ shards.**

**Your contribution is simple:**

1.  **Invent a Shard:**
    * Think of a cool power or effect one small shard could have.
    * **Action:** Add your new shard description as a `.md` file in the `/lore/community/artifacts/` folder. Use the template!

2.  **Decide Who Finds It:**
    * Is it a random person? An animal? Who gets the power or is affected? Does a hero or villain take the shard from them?
    * **Action:** If you create a new character, add their bio as a `.md` file in `/lore/community/characters/`.

3.  **Decide Where:**
    * Did it land in Prime City? A hidden dimension? Bielefeld? A place *you* invent?
    * **Action:** If you create a new location, add its description as a `.md` file in `/lore/community/locations/`.

4.  **Write the "Episode":**
    * Tell the short story (1-2 pages) of what happens when that shard is found and activated.
    * **Action:** Add your story as a `.md` file in the `/lore/community/myths/` folder.

**Every shard is a new story. Every story is a contribution.** We need *your* ideas to build this universe, one shard at a time!
