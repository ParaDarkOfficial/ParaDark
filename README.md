## The Beginning of the Universe

The official origin story of our world is now live:  
  [**Read: The First Spark**](/lore/canon/myths/The_First_Spark.md)

It tells the story of the Quantum Reactor accident that fractured the Prime Dimension and scattered 100 **Shards of Worlds** across reality.

Writers and coders can now expand the world through the `/lore/community/` folder:
- Characters → `/lore/community/characters/`
- Locations → `/lore/community/locations/`
- Artifacts → `/lore/community/artifacts/`
- Myths (short stories) → `/lore/community/myths/`

---

## What is MythiQ-Universe?

A **living mythology** where:
- **Writers** craft characters, myths, and worlds
- **Developers** build interactive lore platforms
- **Artists** visualize the multiverse *(coming soon)*
- **Everyone** shapes the canon through community contributions

Unlike traditional stories, **MythiQ evolves through pull requests** — every accepted contribution becomes part of the official multiverse.
