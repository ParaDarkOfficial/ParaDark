# How to Contribute to MythiQ-UNiverse 

We are so excited you want to help! Hereâ€™s how you can contribute.

## 1. How to Contribute LORE (For Writers)

This is the easiest way to help. You will just be creating a new text file.

1.  Go to the `/lore/` folder in our repository.
2.  Decide if your idea is a **new community story** or **based on official canon**.
    * **New Idea:** Go to the `/lore/community/` folder (e.g., `/myths` or `/characters`).
    * **Official Story:** Go to the `/lore/canon/` folder.
3.  In the top-right corner, click **"Add file"** > **"Create new file"**.
4.  Name your file. Make sure it ends in `.md`.
    * *Example:* `grog-the-fire-demon.md`
5.  Write your story! You can use Markdown to make it look good (e.g., `##` for a title).
6.  When you're done, scroll down and write a short title for your change (like "Added Grog the Fire Demon").
7.  Click the green **"Propose new file"** button.

That's it! You've just submitted a Pull Request. A "Lore Master" will review it and merge it.
