## 1. Contribute LORE (For Writers & World-Builders)

The easiest way to start — no coding required! You'll be adding a new Markdown (`.md`) file that tells your story or expands the existing universe.

### Steps to Contribute:

1. **Go to the `/lore/` folder** in our repository.
2. Decide where your story belongs:
   - **New Community Story:** `/lore/community/` (e.g., `/myths/`, `/characters/`, `/locations/`)
   - **Official Canon Story:** `/lore/canon/`
3. Click **"Add file" → "Create new file"** in GitHub.
4. **Name your file** ending with `.md`
   - Example: `grog-the-fire-demon.md`
5. **Write your story** using Markdown syntax for structure and style.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     # Grog the Fire Demon
     Once a blacksmith, now a burning legend...
     ```
6. Scroll down and write a short description of your change (e.g., *"Added Grog the Fire Demon lore"*).
7. Click the green **"Propose new file"** button.

You've just created your first **Pull Request (PR)**!  
A **Lore Master** will review your story and merge it into the universe.
